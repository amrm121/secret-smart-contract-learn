# Secret Contracts Starter Pack

Integration test now uses .env to define the chain node.

Also, it now verifies if the reset command executes in the contract and assert it.

Will add more stuff as I develop more things to this.

The goal is to create a tutorial to make a Smart Contract in the SN from scratch.
